"""
integration tests package
This package contains integration tests for the covmapy library.
These tests ensure that the library works correctly when integrated with other components and systems.
They typically involve multiple modules and may require external dependencies or configurations.
Integration tests are designed to catch issues that unit tests might miss, such as interactions between components or
dependencies on external systems.
