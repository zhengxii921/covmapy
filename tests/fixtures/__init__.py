"""
fixtures package
This package contains fixtures for the covmapy library.
Fixtures are used to set up a controlled environment for testing, providing predefined data or configurations that can
be reused across multiple tests.
Fixtures help ensure consistency and reliability in tests, allowing developers to focus on testing functionality rather
than setup.
Fixtures can include sample data files, mock objects, or any other resources needed for testing.
They are typically used in conjunction with a testing framework to provide a clean and isolated environment for each
test run.
